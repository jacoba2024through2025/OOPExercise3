There is a test suite to guide you and help you check yourself. To run the test suite, just view `SpecRunner.html` in your browser. I suggest using live server so that your tests rerun when you save you file.

**Important:** The test cases specify the name of the required methods, arguments, etc. So **read each test case carefully.** Test cases are located in the spec folder.

# Exercises
